## Problem Description (Paraphrased)

## Initial Observations

## Polya's method 

### Understand the problem 

#### What is the unknown 

#### What are the data 

#### What is the condition 

#### Can you draw a figure ? 

#### Can you use a suitable notation ?

### Devising a plan 

#### Find the connection between the data and the unknown 

#### Have you seen it before ? or a similar problem ? 

#### Do you know a related problem? Do you know a theorem/algorithm that could be useful?

#### Look at the unknown! Try to think of a familiar problem having the same or a similar unknown 

#### with a problem related to yours and solved before. Could you use it? Could you use its result? Could you use its method? Should you introduce some auxiliary element in order to make its use possible? 

#### Could you restate the problem? Could you restate it still differently ?

#### try to solve first some related problem. Could you imagine a more accessible related problem? 

####  try to solve a more general problem? A more special problem ? An analogous problem ? Could you solve a part of the problem ? 

#### Did you use all the data ? Did you use the whole condition? Have you taken into account all essential notions involved in the problem ? 

### Carrying out a plan 

#### Check each step. Can you see clearly that the step is correct ? Can you prove that it is correct ?

### Looking back 

#### Can you derive the solution differently ? Can you see it at a glance ?

#### Can you use the result, or the method, for some other problem ?
